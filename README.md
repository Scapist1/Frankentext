# Frankentext

This program reads the text from `franken.txt`, tokenizes it, builds a successor map between words (Markov chain), and generates random sentences with the same mystical eerie and dark vibe as the book.  

It keeps generating until it finds both a *question* sentence (`?`) and an *exclamation* sentence (`!`).
